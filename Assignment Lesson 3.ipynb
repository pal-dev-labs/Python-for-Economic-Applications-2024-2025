    "- Try to write the code by yourself based on basic instructions provided in the notebook Lesson 1.\n",
    "- Run the cell and, in case, try to fix the error comparing with code in notebook Lesson 1-2. This phase is IMPORTANT to fix in memory commands and syntax\n",
    "- If you still have problems, go to ChatGPT and write \"create a python code that perform ..exercise..instructions\". Cut and paste the code in a new notebook cell \n",
    "- Customize the code if necessary and run it. \n",
    "- IMPORTANT: go through each single instructions of the new code and try to execute mentally the code in order to understand the flow of the program and the meaning of the commands. There are 2 goals here. First: fix commands meaning and syntax. Second: understand solution strategy\n",
