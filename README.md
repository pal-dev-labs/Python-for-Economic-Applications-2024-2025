# Requirements

**GOOGLE COLAB**:  
The coding activities will be performed in the Google Colab Environment (https://colab.research.google.com/) that is an environment already configured with a Jupyter Notebook.  

**To access the environment you will need a Google account and a Github account. (Remember to bring with you both UID and pwd).**

You can use the laptop of the Lab or your personal laptop (it must able to connect to internet).  
To test the Google Colab Environment:
- go to https://colab.research.google.com/ (log-in to google if requested)
- go to File-Open Notebook and select GitHub 
- in the github url type: pal-dev-labs/Python-for-Economic-Applications 2024-2025 (log-in to github if requested)
- click on TestNotebook.ipynb
- click on the cells with code and run the cell (click on the right arrow in the left of the cell)
- you should plot a pie-chart

**ANACONDA NAVIGATOR**:  
If you prefer, instead of google colab env, you can install the the **Anaconda Navigator** suite on your laptop (downloadable from the website https://anaconda.org/anaconda/anaconda-navigator) and keep all your file locally on your pc.

After the installation, launch the application and open Jupyter Notebook. 
Download the file TestNotebook.ipynb from this web site (see above)
and load it in the notebook.
Run the cells to check that everything is ok (you should plot a pie-chart).

# Course Description:

This course will introduce students to the Python programming language. Students will learn the basics of Python programming, including data types, variables, functions, and control flow statements. They will also learn how to use Python to perform data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.

# Course Objectives:
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Write and understand simple Python programs
- Use Python to perform data analysis and visualization
- Use Python to build and fit basic statistical models
- Apply Python to solve simple economic problems

# Course Outline:
- Introduction to Python programming
- Data types and variables
- Functions and control flow statements
- Data Science libraries
- Data analysis and visualization with Python
- Statistical modeling with Python

# Teaching Methods:
The course will be taught using the notebook Jupyter and the Google Colab Environments. Students will have the opportunity to "learn by coding" and practice Python programming skills through a variety of activities, such as solving coding problems and writing Python programs.

# Assessment:
Students will be assessed on their understanding of Python programming concepts and their ability to apply Python to solve simple problems.

# Prerequisites:
Students should have a basic understanding of mathematics and statistics before taking this course. No prior programming experience is required.
   
# Suggested material and useful links
The course covers multiple topics relating to different scientific disciplines such as Mathematics, Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science and therefore there is no single textbook that contains all the topics.
Below we present a list of material that can be consulted for specific further information.
